# The Next Web home page clone

A clone of [TNW](https://thenextweb.com/)'s home page. The website is build using the modern `css` techniques. I am my pairing partner have utilised the `BEM` naming convention and extracted `utility classes` as much as possible for their reusability purposes.

The website is fully responsive with the help of two `media query` `breakpoints` (the default being the smaller viewport), namely: `< 768px`, `>= 768px`, `>= 1024px`.
